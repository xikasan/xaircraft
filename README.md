# XAircraft

This repository provides the simulation models of aircraft.
This is including the a body dynamics model, a control rudder dynamics.
The non-linear aircraft dynamics model shall be implemented in the future.

## Requirements
- python > 3.7
- numpy > 1.17.2
- xtools > 0.1.0

For the information of xtools, see [here](https://github.com/xikasan/xtools).

## Models
- LVAircraftPitch
    - name: `lvaircraft.pitch-v0`
    - Pitch angle of linear longitudinal dynamics of aircraft body.
